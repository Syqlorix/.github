## Our Mission

The **Syqlorix Organization** is dedicated to pioneering **hyper-minimal, Python-native solutions for modern web development**. We believe in abstracting complexity to empower developers to build dynamic, responsive web interfaces with unparalleled ease and clarity, directly from Python.

Our projects aim to simplify web design and content generation, offering intuitive tools that blend Python's readability with the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all while maintaining a zero-dependency core where possible.

## Our Ecosystem

The Syqlorix ecosystem is growing, currently comprising:

### 1. [Syqlorix - The Core Python Library](https://github.com/Syqlorix/Syqlorix)

This is the heart of our mission. A pure Python Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for crafting full HTML documents, including inline CSS and JavaScript, from a single Python script.

**Key Features:**
*   Pure Python DSL for HTML elements (`page.div()`, `page.h1()`, etc.)
*   Inline CSS (`page.style()`) and JavaScript (`page.script()`)
*   Programmatic CSS generation (`syqlorix.css()`)
*   Specialized form, media, and other element helpers
*   Reusable components (`@syqlorix.component`)
*   Advanced routing system (`syqlorix.Route`)
*   Built-in CLI for development server (`syqlorix serve`) and static site generation (`syqlorix build`)
*   Seamless integration with web frameworks like Flask.

### 2. [Syqlorix Documentation & Examples](https://syqlorix.github.io)

This repository hosts the comprehensive documentation website and all official code examples for the Syqlorix library. It's your go-to resource for detailed guides, API references, and practical demonstrations of Syqlorix's capabilities.

### 3. [Syqlorix Canvas - Visual Editor (In Development)](https://github.com/Syqlorix/syqlorix-canvas)
<!---
